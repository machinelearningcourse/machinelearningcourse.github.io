### **Octave Resources**

At the Octave command line, typing help followed by a function name displays documentation for a built-in function. For example, help plot will bring up help information for plotting. Further documentation can be found at the Octave documentation pages.

### **MATLAB Resources**

At the MATLAB command line, typing help followed by a function name displays documentation for a built-in function. For example, help plot will bring up help information for plotting. Further documentation can be found at the MATLAB documentation pages.


### **Introduction to MATLAB with Onramp**

Made for MATLAB beginners or those looking for a quick refresh, the MATLAB Onramp is a 1-2 hour interactive introduction to the basics of MATLAB programming. Octave users are also welcome to use Onramp (requires creation of a free MathWorks account). To access Onramp:

1.	If you donâ€™t already have one, create a MathWorks account at: https://www.mathworks.com/mwaccount/register

2.	Go to: https://matlabacademy.mathworks.com/ and click on the MATLAB Onramp button to start learning MATLAB!
